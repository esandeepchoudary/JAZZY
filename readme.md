# Secret - Key Encryption Lab
This submission provides two programs coded in Python.
'master_cipher.py' to generate 'cipher.bin' file.
'dictionary_attack_aes.py' to launch a dictionary attack on the 'cipher.bin' file.
This submission also includes files for tasks 3-6.

## Files associated to task 6
```
my_plaintext.txt
cipher.bin
words.txt
master_cipher.py
dictionary_attack_aes.py
makefile_master
makefile_dictionary
```
## Execution environment
This submission ideally runs on SEED labs Ubuntu virtual machine running Python 2.7.5
Syntax changes must be encorporated when executing in different environments or with higher versions of Python.

## Execution Process
Command to execute the master_cipher.py script
```
make -f makefile_master
```

Command to execute the dictionary_attack_aes.py script
```
make -f makefile_dictionary
```
### Note
Since python execution environment does not require separate compilation and execution steps, there are multiple make files. Python, starts the execution after the command is executed.
